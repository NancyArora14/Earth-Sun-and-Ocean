Do make sure the lights in the room are completely off when you use it! Prior to using this skin analyzer, I knew that I had lots of oil on my face, specifically comedones on my chin, but I didn't realize there were SO MANY around my nose, cheeks, and forehead too (so basically my whole face). I'm planning on doing treatments to steam and extract those as well as get facials to target oil, sebum, dead skin trapped in my pores...I really like that not only do I get to see what problems my skin has, I can also test the efficacy of skincare products by checking my skin's progress with the analyzer when I use new products. Overall, super happy with this product.

The risk is significantly lower than what you’d experience from prolonged sun exposure or tanning beds. Your skin’s health is our top priority!
